# What's this?

A small texture that changes stakes stickers AND stickers to take less space, for you to show whatever art you want in case you are developing a texture pack!
And due to how Malverk is set up, it also includes stakes with icons for readability (And because if I needed to add them to make the stakes stickers work, I WILL change them)

# How to install: 

1. You first need steammodded and lovely. I reccomend this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXfslLPxSNk) up until around 3:50

2. Next, you're gonna need to install [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk), as Malverk is a Balatro texture manager which makes changing textures easy!

3. You'll also need to download this texture pack too for it to work. Simply click CODE and download zip

4. You'll need to place both Malverk and this texture pack (Both uncompressed) on the respective Balatro modding folder, usually going to "%appdata%/balatro" will lead you the correct folder.
